# GlamUp-Hair-Salon
Using HTML and CSS, I created a complete static website for a hair salon. I designed the header section of this website, which had a logo, welcome text, and buttons. This website design also includes a vertical side menu. And it has a features section and a services section, both of which have a lovely hover effect on the images. This website design includes a gorgeous user review/testimonials UI design and a website footer design with contact information and social media buttons. This website is fully responsive, and it looks great on both large and small screens.
